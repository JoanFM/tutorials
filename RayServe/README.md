# RayServe + Triton Inference Server Prototype

The goal of this project is to demonstrate an early prototype
integration with RayServe based on Triton's low level python bindings.

A thin partial "pythonic wrapper" is also provided as an early preview
of the type of high level api that will be provided in a coming Triton
release.

>[Note] This code is early prototype only and is not meant for
>production and is subject to change.
